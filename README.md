# ecoleta_starter
Ecoleta's application, developed during Rocketseat's Next Level Week 11, with modifications of my own.

Here i try to use every knowlodge i'm colleting through the start of my carrer in practice.

The application itself is a website for recycling companies to register their pickup points and for users
to search and find those points.

  . Criantion of a standard api response as api_routes.js so that the application delivers a JSON
  containing every registered point.
  . PLANNED: increasing of the complexity of the request URL to accomodate user preference (state and/or city) and to deliver the response accordingly.

  . Criation of routes.js to better organize the project
